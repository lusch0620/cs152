Note: This week, it is free response rather than multiple choice
1. How is a tree different from a linked list?
A linked list is connected by next pointers whereas a tree has can be 
connected to 0, 1, or 2 nodes. 


2. What are the two properties that define a binary search tree?
	1. The data stored at each node has a distinguished key which is unique
		in the tree and belongs to a total order
	2. The key of any node is greater than all keys occurring in its left
		subtree and less than all keys occurring in its right subtree

3. What type do we use when we want it to be a pointer, but we don't want to restrict the type to which the pointer points?
A void pointer



If you make an ordered data structure (e.g. sorted linked list or BST), you need to perform comparisons to sort the data. If you are implementing a generic data structure that is allowed to hold any type, you need to accept a compare function as an input. What is the signature / prototype of that function that will be passed in?
c) int compare(void *x, void *y);
