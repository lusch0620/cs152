## -10 hw4.c could not get to compile, missing semicolons and using other variables not in scope

;; count_vowels				/ 4
Off-by-one error - a systemic error that affects almost all
tests, but is a really small error.

;; make_lowercase			/ 4
Off-by-one error - a systemic error that affects almost all
tests, but is a really small error.

For stripes & board - These are only if all of their other tests failed
in order to give partial credit for something not expressed in the tests
;; make_horizontal_stripes		/ 8
+8 - Works, only gets a color component incorrect
+5 - makes something stripish but not quite right

;; make_checker_board			/ 8
+8 - Works, only gets a color component incorrect
+5 - makes something checkerboardish but not quite right


;; hiding secrets			10 / 10
+10 - hides part of the picture properly. Sample errors could be 
that it retains a small bit of the reference picture or it is 
turned on its side.

;; extracting secrets			10 / 10
+10 - hides part of the picture properly. Sample errors could be 
that it retains a small bit of the reference picture, it is 
turned on its side, or it's all a bit red.

Testing: look for tests with different filenames.
If they used command-line arguments, look for testscript.
You may need to look in student's original repository - it may not
all be copied over. They don't need to test encode and decode individually-
can do the whole shebang. Don't TRY to take points off - just if you 
can't find evidence of good testing methodology.

;; === efficiency ===
;; good decisions for control structures 5 / 5
 -2 - inappropriate control structure (if/else where switch should have been)
 -2 - repeated function calls with same input and same result

;; === problem-specific requirements ===
