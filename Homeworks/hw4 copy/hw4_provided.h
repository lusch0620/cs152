/* provided_read_png
 * Reads in a png from filename and populates the rgb arrays as well
 * as the image width and length. All out parameter space must have been
 * allocated prior to the function call. This function does not allocate
 * memory for use outside of it.
 *
 * in parameters:
 *   char *filename - the filename to read from
 * out parameters:
 *   red[ROWS][COLS] - 2D array to which red pixel values will be placed.
 *   green[ROWS][COLS] - 2D array to which green pixel values will be placed.
 *   blue[ROWS][COLS] - 2D array to which blue pixel values will be placed.
 *   uint *image_width - the width of the read-in image
 *   uint *image_length - the length of the read-in image
