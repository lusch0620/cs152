;; === 
;; partial credit returned via visual inspection - only for
;; problems on which you earned fewer points than you can get back.
;; if you got more than 0 points, then the partial credit is scaled.
;; look at code for grader notes if bugs identified

;; draw_hourglass_rec	-   
make sure no points are taken off for something that you can't see visually - 
like perhaps an extra space at the end of the line. That should restore
all points back.
+8 - only problem is systemic minor printing difficulty like extra line somewhere
+2 - draws something hourglass-ish in a recursive manner
				
;; draw_hourglass_iter	-   /

;; play_mastermind
;; if there are some visual mismatches, grade this way instead
take off once per category, not once per instance.
-0 - visual mismatch that is only extra line or spacing, nothing
   - against the requirements
-1 - minor mismatch that involves using a different printf than provided
-2 - doesn't print out the guess number properly
-2 - doesn't choose between Congratulations and not quite properly
-2 - doesn't print out feedback properly
-5 - doesn't ask for multiple guesses

;; well-named variables		     4 / 4
(i, j, k okay for simple loop counters. Meaningful names for others.)
;; adequate tests                    8 / 8
(for each function, tests that exercise pertinent functionality and error conditions)

;; === efficiency ===
;; good decisions for control structures 5 / 5
 -2 - inappropriate control structure (if/else where switch should have been)
 -2 - repeated function calls with same input and same result

;; === problem-specific requirements === 
;; Remove points from correctness testing if they don't use recursion when specified.
;; This refers to the recursive problems
